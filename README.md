Fantasy baseball points projections via ZiPS
*Note: Data are not included in this repository. FanGraphs requires a membership to access these data, therefore I will not be providing the data for free.*

### Project Purpose:
Every year a few million people participate in fantasy baseball drafts. Many of them put hours of research and preparation to identify the best players, best value, and any potential deep sleepers. This project aims to help fantasy baseball GMs estimate the points their players will score with any custom league settings.

### The Data:
I purchased the ZiPS data via a subscription from FanGraphs. I used these projections as the "true" value of each player's production. Obviously, they are projections and are subject to error. Dan Szymborski does a wonderful job with his projections, you can find his 2025 introduction [here.](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/the-2025-zips-projections-are-imminent/) If you love baseball enough to care about fantasy projections, then you'll love his writing.

It is important to note that the projections are the median projection from many simulations. The median is not always the best way to describe a distribution.
